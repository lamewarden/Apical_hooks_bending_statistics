 Notebooks for the phototropism/apical hooks statistical evaluation
*.xlsx files are input files. 

Notebooks are designed to build a linear regression on a base of a time series, which describes dynamics of the apical hook development (AH) or hypocotyls gravitropic bending (GB).
Further, slopes and intercept values of regressions are extracted and compared between different plant line samples by ANOVA with Tukey HSD post-hoc test and visualizes diferrences.
