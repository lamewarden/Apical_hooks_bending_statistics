 Notebooks for the phototropism/gravitopism/apical hooks statistical evaluation
*.xlsx files are input files. 

Notebooks are designed to build a linear regression based on measurements from Apical Hook development (AH), hypocotyls Gravitropic (GB), and Phototropic Bending (GB) experiments.
During the time-lapse, angle of the apical hook (AH) / hypocotyl (GB)/(PB) was measured each 4h (AH) / 1h (GB)/(PB). Resulting in complex curves, representing seedling development over time, which were split into developmental phases, represented by linear regions. These linear regions were further analyzed with linear regression.
Obtained values for slopes and intercepts were compared between different plant lines using one-way ANOVA with Tukey HSD posthoc test and visualized.
